Uniswap V2 is minimally modified to implement the Greedy Sequencing Rule (GSR), a verifiable sequencing rule that mitigates sandwich attacks.

## The Greedy Sequencing Rule

The GSR is a specific implementation of a verifiable sequencing rule that provides strong execution guarantees for users. For a user transaction $A$ that the proposer includes in the block (Theorem 5.2, p. 22), it guarantees that for a valid ordering it must be that either:

1. the user efficiently detects the proposer did not respect the sequencing rule, or
2. the execution price of $A$ for the user is at least as good as if $A$ was the only transaction in the block, or
3. the execution price of $A$ is worse than this standalone price but the proposer does not gain when including A in the block.

It works as follows: 

1. Initialize an empty execution ordering $T$.
2. Partition outstanding transactions into buy orders ($B_{buy}$) and sell orders ($B_{sell}$).
3. While both $B_{buy}$ and $B_{sell}$ are non-empty:
    - If current token 1 reserves â‰¥ initial token 1 reserves:
        - Append any order from $B_{buy}$ to $T$
    - Else:
        - Append any order from $B_{sell}$ to $T$
4. If any orders remain, append them to $T$ in any order.

The rule exploits a key property of two-token liquidity pools: at any state, either all buy orders or all sell orders will receive a better execution price than at the initial state (Theorem 5.1 "Duality Theorem", p. 20).

## Implementation

The goal is for the algorithm to check new transactions in real-time, determining whether a new transaction violates the GSR. This differs from the original algorithm in the paper, which checks the entire order of transactions in a block. Instead of checking all the past transactions every time we receive a new one to determine whether the order is valid, we assume the state up to that point is valid and only check the new transaction. If the new transaction is valid, the order after the inclusion of the transaction is valid. If the new transaction is invalid, the order is invalid. This approach is more efficient than checking the entire block, and leads to a constant-time verification algorithm for new swaps, instead of a linear-time algorithm, as in the original paper.

The implementation of the entire algorithm involves adding 24 lines of code to the swap function.

```solidity
function swap(uint amount0Out, uint amount1Out, address to, bytes calldata data) external lock {
    ...
    if (block.number > sequencingRuleInfo.blockNumber) {
        // We have a new block, so we must reset the sequencing rule info
        sequencingRuleInfo.blockNumber = block.number;
        sequencingRuleInfo.reserve0Start = _reserve0;
        sequencingRuleInfo.emptyBuysOrSells = false;
    } else {
        // Get the swap type (i.e., buy or sell)
        SwapType swapType = amount0Out > 0 ? SwapType.BUY : SwapType.SELL;

        if (sequencingRuleInfo.emptyBuysOrSells) {
            // If we have run out of buys or sells, the swap type must be the same as for the tail swap
            require(swapType == sequencingRuleInfo.tailSwapType, "UniswapV2: Swap violates sequencing rule");
        } else {
            // Find the required swap type so we can validate against it
            SwapType requiredSwapType = _reserve0 >= sequencingRuleInfo.reserve0Start ? SwapType.SELL : SwapType.BUY;

            if (swapType != requiredSwapType) {
                // We must have run out of buys or sells
                sequencingRuleInfo.emptyBuysOrSells = true;

                // Set the tail swap type
                sequencingRuleInfo.tailSwapType = swapType;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This implementation is computationally efficient and verifiable, allowing anyone to check if the execution ordering follows the GSR. It does not have any external depedencies, and it does not dependent on any off-chain computation, trust in external parties, or additional infrastructure.

## Benefits

This solution is effective because it:

- Protects against sandwich attacks.
- Has a constant-time overhead on the swap function.
- Preserves atomic composability.
- Requires minimal changes to the existing Uniswap v2 codebase.

## Limitations

While the GSR prevents classic sandwich attacks, it doesn't eliminate all forms of MEV. The paper proves that for any sequencing rule, there exist scenarios where proposers can obtain risk-free profits (Theorem 4.2, p. 17-18).

Multi-block MEV remains a consideration, where a proposer that proposes consecutive blocks could influence the initial price used by a given swap. Nevertheless, this can potentially be addressed by updating this initial price less frequently or using a moving average over several past blocks instead. Either approach would raise the costs associated with this vector.
